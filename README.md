This mod for the game *From the Depths* adds several improvements and new features to the Adventure Gamemode, including:

- Allowing enemies to spawn much closer or further away  
- Enabling fortress spawns (designed for use with the Adventure Randomiser)  
- Scaling resource zones based on difficulty  
- Customizing the adventure bell’s cooldown and allowing it to ignore altitude  
- Changing the difficulty of all spawned enemies  
- Forcing enemy spawns (also with a timer, which might be handy for challenge runs!)  
- Custom Encounters, which replace a normal spawn and send one of the various challenges towards you!
- Sandboxing options, made for debugging and testing purposes, which include:  
Sending you through a Blue/Red/Green Portal  
Spawning an enemy or despawning all enemies  
Blocking naturally occuring enemy spawns(Bell and Forced spawns are not blocked intentionally.)

You can customize the behavior of each feature—or disable them entirely—through the options menu.

Changes should apply immediately.

Multiplayer is supported as long as the host has the mod installed. For clients many settings are missing since most of them only work as a host.

Feedback and feature suggestions are always appreciated!

Thanks to Melezhor for helping me with tests and Rinathunderpanzer for helping me figure out how to move the settings into ftd options

Custom Encounters(subject to change, looking for feedback!)
